Subject: CS Student Interested in Neurofeedback: Looking for Advice
----------------------------------------
Dear W Mans,

I am currently a 3rd year undergraduate student at CMU studying CS, and am looking for advice from neuroscience researchers on how neurofeedback works. Would you have 15m to chat about this sometime, or alternatively, any recommendations for ways to learn more about or get involved in the field?

I have come to realize that I am exclusively passionate about helping people, and within that most passionate about healing trauma. After reading a few papers, I am considering neurofeedback as the most promising path to impact. It works!

I do not currently have the knowledge to properly grapple with your research contributions, but am planning on diving into your papers and write to you again once I do so. Thank you for your contributions to this space.

All the best,
Hamza
